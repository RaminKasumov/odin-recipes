        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (29 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
            <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large skillet, cook and stir ground beef until brown. Add onions and garlic, and 
                cook until onions are transparent. Stir in tomato sauce, tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, 
                basil, salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring 
                occasionally.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling 
                water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, 
                combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. 
                Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta 
                cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat 
                sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and 
                top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, 
                either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. 
                Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
